\begin{problem}{7.35}
A subset of the nodes of a graph $G$ is a \textbf{\textit{dominating}} set if every other node of $G$ is adjacent to some node in the subset. Let
\[
DOMINATING-SET = \{\langle G, k \rangle \ | \ G \text{ has a dominating set with } k \text{ nodes}\}.
\]
Show that it is NP-complete by giving a reduction from $VERTEX-COVER$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
To show that $DOMINATING-SET$ is NP-complete, we must show that it is in NP and that all NP-problems are polynomial time reducible to it. The first part is easy; a certificate is simply the subset of nodes. To prove the second part, we show that $VERTEX-COVER$ is polynomial time reducible to $DOMINATING-SET$. The reduction converts an undirected graph $G$ and integer $k$ into an undirected graph $G'$ and integer $k'$, so that $G$ has a $k$-node vertex cover, iff $G'$ has a $k'$-node dominating set. \\

The graph $G'$ contains a node for every node and edge in $G$. The nodes in $G'$ that correspond to nodes in $G$ are all connected to each other. Every node in $G'$ that corresponds to an edge $u$ in $G$ is connected to two nodes $x$ and $y$ in $G'$, where $u$ connects the corresponding nodes of $x$ and $y$ in $G$. The integer $k'$ equals $k$.

Graph $G$ has a 2-node vertex cover, and $G'$ has 2-node dominating set.

Suppose $G$ has a $k$-node vertex cover. We show that the subset $D$ of $k$-nodes in $G'$ that correspond to the $k$-node vertex cover forms a $k$-node dominating set. First, all nodes in $G'$ that corresponds to nodes in $G$ are adjacent to every node in $D$. Second, all nodes in $G'$ that correspond to edges in $G$ are also adjacent to one of the nodes in $D$. \\

Suppose $G'$ has a $k'$-node dominating set. Then, the dominating set gives a $k'$-node vertex cover in $G$.
