\begin{problem}{2.20}
Let $A/B = \{w \ | \ wx \in A \ for \ some \ x \in B\}$. Show that if $A$ is context free and $B$ is regular, then $A/B$ is context free.
\end{problem}

\begin{idea}[Informal description.]
Use DFA for B to generate its strings, which are pushed to the stack.
  Once a string is generate...
    Transition non-deter. to start state of A's PDA
    Transition as usual through the PDA's states by reading the input
\end{idea}
