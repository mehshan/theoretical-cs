\begin{problem}{7.26}
Let $\phi$ be a 3cnf-formula. An \textbf{$\neq$\textit{-assignment}} to the variables of $\phi$ is one where each clause contains two literals with unequal truth values. In other words, an $\neq$\textit{-assignment} satisfies $\phi$ without assigning three true literals in any clause.
\end{problem} 

\begin{problem}[Part]{a}
Show that the negation of any $\neq$\textit{-assignment} to $\phi$ is also an $\neq$\textit{-assignment}.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\phi$ be a 3cnf-formula with $n$ variables. Let $A = (v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n)$ be an $\neq$\textit{-assignment} to the variables $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ of $\phi$. The negation of $A$ is $A' = (\overline{v_1}, \overline{v_2}, \cdots, \overline{v_n})$. Every clause in $\phi$ contains at least one literal that is assigned $false$ value by $A$, and at least one literal that is assigned $true$. Therefore, $A'$ also assigns at lease one literal $false$ and at least one literal $true$ in each clause. Thus, $A'$ is also an $\neq$\textit{-assignment}.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[Part]{b}
Let $\neq$\textit{SAT} be the collection of 3cnf-formulas that have an $\neq$\textit{-assignment}. Show that we obtain a polynomial time reduction from $3SAT$ to $\neq$\textit{SAT} by replacing each clause $c_i$
\[
(y_1 \vee y_2 \vee y_3)
\]
with the two clauses
\[
(y_1 \vee y_2 \vee z_i) \textbf{ and } (\overline{z_i} \vee y_3 \vee b),
\]
where $z_i$ is a new variable for each clause $c_i$, and $b$ is a single additional new variable.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
We show that $\phi \in 3SAT$, iff $\phi_{\neq} \in \ \neq$\textit{SAT}. \\

Suppose that $\phi$ has a satisfying assignment. In that satisfying assignment, at least one literal is true in every clause. Let $c_i$ be any clause $(y_1 \vee y_2 \vee y_3)$ in $\phi$. The corresponding two clauses in $\phi_{\neq}$ are
\[
(y_1 \vee y_2 \vee z_i) \textbf{ and } (\overline{z_i} \vee y_3 \vee b).
\]
An $\neq$\textit{-assignment} satisfying $\phi_{\neq}$ can be constructed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assign false to $b$.
\item If $y_3$ is false, then assign false to $z_i$.
\item If $y_3$ is true, then assign true to $z_i$.
\end{enumerate}

The other direction is trivially true, since $\phi_{\neq}$ is a satisfiable 3cnf-formula. The reduction from $3SAT$ to $\neq$\textit{SAT} consists of only one stage that executes $m$ times, where $m$ is the number of clauses in $\phi$. Furthermore, this stage can be easily implemented in polynomial time on any reasonable deterministic model.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[Part]{c}
Conclude that $\neq$\textit{SAT} is NP-complete.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
$\neq$\textit{SAT} $\in$ NP as the assignment is the short certificate. Therefore, $\neq$\textit{SAT} is NP-complete.
\end{proof}
